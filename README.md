## 🌱 Project Purpose

LumiNexis is not just a website — it is a **living archive** of experiences, beliefs, and ambitions.  
Through this site, the creator expresses how their childhood dreams, personal struggles, and resilience are connected to their current pursuit in the IT and creative fields.

This portfolio aims to:
- Document and share the philosophy behind the brand  
- Present the creator's design, development, and storytelling skills  
- Serve as a personal hub for future expansion (e.g. blog, API integration, etc.)
